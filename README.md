## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I spent a while trying to figure this project using a grid instead of flexbox. Ultimately, I still ended up using a flexbox but I did learn a lot about grids and look forward to being able to utilize the new knowledge.
